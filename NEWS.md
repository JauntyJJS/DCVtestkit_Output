# DCVtestkit Output 0.0.3.9000 (development version)

## TODO

### Done

### Manuscript

* Change title to "*DCVtestkit*: a R package for linearity assessment and visualisation of multiple curves"
* Found a way to change figure title from Figure to Supplementary Figure in `supplementary.qmd`.
* Found a way to add page break `{{< pagebreak >}}` in the Quarto document.
* Change figure in `manscript.qmd` to a merged figure of the curve grouping workflow diagram and the interactive plot diagram.
* Transfer *DCVtestkit* workflow diagram from `manscript.qmd` to `supplementary.qmd`.
* Add relevant equations for Mandel's Fitting Test and Percent Residual Accuracy. Thank you [njbart](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/discussions/3236) for the help.

# DCVtestkit Output 0.0.1

Version first send to via email on 8 Oct 2022.

* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
* Create a folder `Quarto_Example` that contains some output from [`DCVtestkit`](https://github.com/SLINGhub/DCVtestkit) and scripts that generate the results.
* Create a folder `Manuscript` that contains the manuscript for [`DCVtestkit`](https://github.com/SLINGhub/DCVtestkit).
* Create a folder `Quarto_Simulation` that contains scripts to see how [`DCVtestkit`](https://github.com/SLINGhub/DCVtestkit) does on simulated dilution data.
